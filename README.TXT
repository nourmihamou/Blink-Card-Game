PROJECT TITLE: Modified Blink
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program prompts the user to input the cards to match player one's cards and player two's cards, and then outputs the result of the hand. Each card is entered as a 5 character string. The cards to match are entered on one line (at least two cards). E.g., if 1YEMO 3BLST is entered, the cards to match are One Yellow Moon and Three Blue Stars. Player one's cards are entered on one line, as are player two's cards. After the input is read, each player's hand is printed followed by the result of the match. 
Possible colors include Yellow, Red, Green, Blue, Brown, and Grey ("YE", "RE", "GR", "BL", "BR", "GY", respectively)
Possible shapes include Moon, Sun, Star, Snowflake, Lightning Bolt, and Raindrop ("MO", "SU", "ST", "SN", "LB", "RA", respectively)
Numbers range from 1 to 5, inclusive
